In hw1/, includes 
*	hw1\_rnn.sh
*	hw1\_cnn.sh
*	hw1\_best.sh
*	test\_rnn.py
*	test\_cnn.py
*	test\_best.py
*	model\_rnn.py
*	model\_cnn.py
*	model\_best.py
*	model\_best\_soft.py
*	RNN/, CNN\_RNN/, Best/

Where model\_best.py and model\_best\_soft.py are the training codes for the best model. <br />
Other files are in RNN/, CNN\_RNN/, Best/, e.g. preprocessing codes. <br />
Also the models are too large, so I put them in my Dropbox. <br />
When testing, it needs to download by wget first. <br />
